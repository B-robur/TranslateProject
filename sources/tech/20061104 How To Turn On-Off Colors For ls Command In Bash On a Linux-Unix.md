How To Turn On/Off Colors For ls Command In Bash On a Linux/Unix
======

How do I turn on or off file name colors (ls command colors) in bash shell on a Linux or Unix like operating systems?

Most modern Linux distributions and Unix systems comes with alias that defines colors for your file. However, ls command is responsible for displaying color on screen for files, directories and other file system objects.

By default, color is not used to distinguish types of files. You need to pass --color option to the ls command on Linux. If you are using OS X or BSD based system pass -G option to the ls command. The syntax is as follows to turn on or off colors.

#### How to turn off colors for ls command

Type the following command
`$ ls --color=none`
Or just remove alias with the unalias command:
`$ unalias ls`
Please note that the following bash shell aliases are defined to display color with the ls command. Use combination of [alias command][1] and [grep command][2] as follows:
`$ alias | grep ls`
Sample outputs
```
alias l='ls -CF'
alias la='ls -A'
alias ll='ls -alF'
alias ls='ls --color=auto'
```
