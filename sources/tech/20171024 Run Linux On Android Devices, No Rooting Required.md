The other day I was searching for a simple and easy way to run Linux on Android. My only intention was to just use Linux with some basic applications like SSH, Git, awk etc. Not much! I don't want to root the Android device. I have a Tablet PC that I mostly use for reading EBooks, news, and few Linux blogs. I don't use it much for other activities. So, I decided to use it for some Linux activities. After spending few minutes on Google Play Store, one app immediately caught my attention and I wanted to give it a try. If you're ever wondered how to run Linux on Android devices, this one might help.

### Termux - An Android terminal emulator to run Linux on Android and Chrome OS

**Termux** is an Android terminal emulator and Linux environment app. Unlike many other apps, you don 't need to root your device or no setup required. It just works out of the box! A minimal base Linux system will be installed automatically, and of course you can install other packages with APT package manager. In short, you can use your Android device like a pocket Linux computer. It's not just for Android, you can install it on your Chrome OS too.

Termux offers many significant features than you would think.

  * It allows you to SSH to your remote server via openSSH.
  * You can also SSH into your Android devices from any remote system.
  * Sync your smart phone contacts to a remote system using rsync and curl.
  * You could choose any shells such as BASH, ZSH, and FISH etc.
  * You can choose different text editors such as Emacs, Nano, and Vim to edit/view files.
  * Install any packages of your choice in your Android devices using APT package manager. Up-to-date versions of Git, Perl, Python, Ruby and Node.js are all available.
  * Connect your Android device with a bluetooth Keyboard, mouse and external display and use it like a convergence device. Termux supports keyboard shortcuts .
  * Termux allows you to run almost all GNU/Linux commands.



It also has some extra features. You can enable them by installing the addons. For instance, **Termux:API** addon will allow you to Access Android and Chrome hardware features. The other useful addons are:

  * Termux:Boot - Run script(s) when your device boots.
  * Termux:Float - Run Termux in a floating window.
  * Termux:Styling - Provides color schemes and powerline-ready fonts to customize the appearance of the Termux terminal.
  * Termux:Task - Provides an easy way to call Termux executables from Tasker and compatible apps.
  * Termux:Widget - Provides an easy way to start small scriptlets from the home screen.



To know more about termux, open the built-in help section by long-pressing anywhere on the terminal and selecting the Help menu option. The only drawback is it **requires Android 5.0 and higher versions**. It could be more useful for many users if it supports Android 4.x and older versions. Termux is available in **Google Play Store** and **F-Droid**.

To install Termux from Google Play Store, click the following button.
