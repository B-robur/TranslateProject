Ubuntu Budgie is just one of the few officially recognized flavors of Ubuntu. Jack Wallen takes a look at some important differences between them.[Used with permission][7]

Ubuntu Budgie 只是为数不多的乌班图官方认可的版本之一。Jack Wallen（杰克沃伦）发现了它们之间的重要的区别。

Ubuntu Linux comes in a few officially recognized flavors, as well as several derivative distributions. The recognized flavors are:
Ubuntu Linux 有一些官方认证版本，还有一些衍生版本：
*   [Kubuntu][9] - Ubuntu with the KDE desktop
*   [Kubuntu][9] - KDE 桌面版 Ubuntu
*   [Lubuntu][10] - Ubuntu with the LXDE desktop
*   [Lubuntu][10] - LXDE 桌面版 Ubuntu
*   [Mythbuntu][11] - MythTV 版 Ubuntu
*   [Ubuntu Budgie][12] - Ubuntu with the Budgie desktop
*   [Ubuntu Budgie][12] - Budgie 桌面版 Ubuntu 
*   [Xubuntu][8] - Ubuntu with Xfce
*   [Xubuntu][8] - Xfce 版 Ubuntu   

Up until recently, the official Ubuntu Linux included the in-house Unity desktop and a sixth recognized flavor existed: Ubuntu GNOME -- Ubuntu with the GNOME desktop environment.
直到最近，官方Ubuntu Linux 还包括了内部的Unity桌面和和第六个被认证的版本：Ubuntu GNOME —— Ubuntu的GNOME桌面环境。
When Mark Shuttleworth decided to nix Unity, the choice was obvious to Canonical—make GNOME the official desktop of Ubuntu Linux. This begins with Ubuntu 18.04 (so April, 2018) and we’ll be down to the official distribution and four recognized flavors.
当马克·沙特尔沃思(Mark Shuttleworth)决定要终止Unity的时候，这个选择很明显是为了让 GNOME 成为 Ubuntu Linux 的官方桌面。 这将从Ubuntu 18.04(2018年4月)开始，我们将会发布发行版和四种认证版本。
For those already enmeshed in the Linux community, that’s some seriously simple math to do—you know which Linux desktop you like, so making the choice between Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Mythbuntu, Ubuntu Budgie, and Xubuntu couldn’t be easier. Those that haven’t already been indoctrinated into the way of Linux won’t see that as such a cut-and-dried decision.
对于那些已经融入Linux社区的人来说,那就是一些非常简单的数学问题——你知道你喜欢哪个版本的 Linux 桌面，但是在Ubuntu、Kubuntu、Lubuntu、Mythbuntu、Ubuntu Budgie 和 Xubuntu 之间做出选择是不容易的。那些还没有融入到 Linux 的人将不会认为这是一个如此简单的决定。 
To that end, I thought it might be a good idea to help newer users decide which flavor is best for them. After all, choosing the wrong distribution out of the starting gate can make for a less-than-ideal experience.
为此，我认为帮助新用户决定选择哪个版本对他们最好可能是至关重要的。毕竟，从一开始就选择一个不合适的发行版是一种不太理想的体验。
And so, if you’re considering a flavor of Ubuntu, and you want your experience to be as painless as possible, read on.
因此，如果你正考虑选择哪个Ubuntu的发行版，如果你想让你的体验尽可能不痛苦，继续往下看。
### Ubuntu

I’ll begin with the official flavor of Ubuntu. I am also going to warp time a bit and skip Unity, to launch right into the upcoming GNOME-based distribution. Beyond GNOME being an incredibly stable and easy to use desktop environment, there is one very good reason to select the official flavor—support. The official flavor of Ubuntu is commercially supported by Canonical. For $150.00 per year, you can purchase [official support][20] for the Ubuntu desktop. There is, of course, a 50-desktop minimum for this level of support. For individuals, the best bet for support would be the [Ubuntu Forums][21], the [Ubuntu documentation][22], or the [Community help wiki][23].
我将从Ubuntu的官方风格开始。我也会有点扭曲时间，跳过Unity，直接进入即将到来的基于GNOME 的发行版。除了GNOME是一个难以置信的稳定和易于使用的桌面环境外，有一个很好的理由选择官方的风格支持。Ubuntu的官方风格是由Canonical提供商业支持的。每年$ 150.00，您可以购买[official support][20]到Ubuntu桌面版。当然，这一级别的支持最小50个桌面。对于个人来说，最好的支持是[Ubuntu Forums][21]，[Ubuntu documentation][22]，或者[Community help wiki][23]。
Beyond the commercial support, the reason to choose the official Ubuntu flavor would be if you’re looking for a modern, full-featured desktop that is incredibly reliable and easy to use. GNOME has been designed to serve as a platform perfectly suited for both desktops and laptops (Figure 1). Unlike its predecessor, Unity, GNOME can be far more easily customized to suit your needs—to a point. If you’re not one to tinker with the desktop, fear not, GNOME just works. In fact, the out of the box experience with GNOME might well be one of the finest on the market—even rivaling (or besting) Mac OS X. If tinkering and tweaking is of primary interest, you will find GNOME somewhat limiting. The [GNOME Tweak Tool][24] and [GNOME Shell Extensions ][25]will only take you so far, before you find yourself wanting more.
在商业支持之外，选择Ubuntu官方风格的原因是，如果你想要一个现代的、功能齐全的桌面，它是非常可靠和易用的。 GNOME被设计成适合桌面和笔记本电脑桌面的平台(图 1)。与它的前身Unity不同，GNOME可以更方便地定制到某一点，以适合你的需要。 如果你不喜欢摆弄桌面，不要担心，GNOME只是一种工作形式而已。 事实上，与GNOME打交道的经验说明它可能是市场上最优秀的桌面，甚至可以与Mac OS X媲美(或者更好)，如果修补和调整是主要的兴趣所在，你会发现GNOME在一定程度上是受限制的。 [GNOME Tweak Tool][24]和[GNOME Shell Extensions][25]只会让你走得更远，直到你发现自己想要更多。

### Kubuntu

The [K Desktop Environment][26] (otherwise known as KDE) has been around as long as GNOME and has, at times, been maligned as a lesser desktop. With the release of KDE Plasma 5, that changed. KDE has become an incredibly powerful, efficient, and stable desktop that can stand toe to toe with the best of them. But why would you select Kubuntu over the official Ubuntu? The answer to that question is quite simple—you’re used to the Windows XP/7 desktop metaphor. Start menu, taskbar, system tray, etc., KDE has those and more, all fashioned in such a way that will make you feel like you’re using the best of the past and current technologies. In fact, if you’re looking for one of the most Windows 7-like official Ubuntu flavors, you won’t find one that better fits the bill.
[K Desktop Environment][26]  (也称为KDE)在GNOME中一直存在，有时被认为是一个较轻量级的桌面。随着KDE Plasma 5的发布，情况发生了变化。KDE已经成为一个强大的、高效的、稳定的桌面，它可能成为桌面系统中最好的。但是你为什么要在Ubuntu官方选择Kubuntu呢?这个问题的答案很简单——你习惯了Windows XP/ 7桌面模式。开始菜单，任务栏，系统托盘，等等，KDE有这些或者更多，所有的方式都会让你觉得你在利用过去和现在的最好的技术。事实上，如果你正在寻找一款像Windows 7极其相似的Ubuntu官方版本，除了它你就找不到更好的了。
One of the nice things about Kubuntu, is that you’ll find it a bit more flexible than any Windows iteration you’ve ever used—and equally reliable/user-friendly. And don’t think, because KDE opts to offer a desktop somewhat similar to Windows 7, that it doesn’t have a modern flavor. In fact, Kubuntu takes what worked well with the Windows 7 interface and updates it to meet a more modern aesthetic (Figure 2).
Kubuntu的优点之一是，你会发现它比你以前使用过的任何Windows版本都灵活，而且同样可靠/友好。不要想，因为KDE 提供的桌面有点类似于Windows 7，它没有现代的味道。事实上，Kubuntu用Windows 7的界面进行了很好的处理，并更新了它以满足更现代的审美(图2)。

The official Ubuntu is not the only flavor to offer desktop support. Kubuntu users also can pay for [commercial support][27]. Be warned, it’s not cheap. One hour of support time will cost you $103.88 cents.
官方的Ubuntu并不是提供桌面支持的唯一方式。Kubuntu用户也可以支付[commercial support][27]。注意，它不便宜。一个小时时间的支持将花费你103.88美分。
### Lubuntu

If you’re looking for an easy-to-use desktop that is very fast (so that older hardware will feel like new) and far more flexible than just about any desktop you’ve ever used, Lubuntu is what you want. The only caveat to Lubuntu is that you’re looking at a bit more bare bones on the desktop then you may be accustomed to. Lubuntu makes use of the [LXDE desktop][28] and includes a list of applications that continues the lightweight theme. So if you’re looking for blazing fast speeds on the desktop, Lubuntu might be a good choice.
However, there is a caveat with Lubuntu and, for some users, this might be a deal breaker. Along with the small footprint of Lubuntu come pre-installed applications that might not stand up to task. For example, instead of the full-blown office suite, you’ll find the [AibWord word processor][29] and the [Gnumeric spreadsheet][30] tool. Don’t get me wrong; both of these are fine tools. However, if you’re looking for software that’s business-ready, you will find them lacking. On the other hand, if you want to install more work-centric tools (e.g., LibreOffice), Lubuntu includes the Synaptic Package Manager to make installation of third-party software simple.
如果你正在寻找一个易于使用的桌面，它是非常快的(因为旧的硬件会感觉像新的一样)，而且比你以前使用的任何桌面都灵活得多，那么 Lubuntu 就是你想要的。对Lubuntu唯一的警告是，你在桌面上看到的是一些更裸露的梗概，那么你可能已经习惯了。Lubuntu使用[LXDE desktop][28]，并包含一个应用程序列表，该列表延续了轻量级主题。因此，如果你想在桌面上寻找快速的体验，Lubuntu 可能是个不错的选择。 然而，Lubuntu有一个警告，对于一些用户来说，这可能是一种破坏。随着Lubuntu的小规模开发，预先安装的应用程序可能无法胜任任务。例如，您将发现[AibWord word processor][29]和[Gnumeric spreadsheet][30]工具而不是成熟的办公套件。别误会,这两个都是很好的工具。然而，如果你正在寻找一款适合商业的软件，你会发现它们缺乏友好的支持。另一方面，如果你想要安装更多的以工作为中心的工具(例如LibreOffice)，Lubuntu包括了联合的软件包管理器来简化第三方软件的安装。
Even with the limited default software, Lubuntu offers a clean and easy to use desktop (Figure 3), that anyone could start using with little to no learning curve.
即使使用了有限的默认软件，Lubuntu也提供了一个简单易用的桌面(图3)，任何人都可以开始使用，几乎没有学习曲线。

### Mythbuntu

Mythbuntu is a sort of odd bird here, because it isn’t really a desktop variant. Instead, Mythbuntu is a special flavor of Ubuntu designed to be a multimedia powerhouse. Using Mythbuntu requires TV Tuners and TV Out cards. And, during the installation, there are a number of additional steps that must be taken (choosing how to set up the frontend/backend as well as setting up your IR remotes).

If you do happen to have the hardware (and the desire to create your own Ubuntu-powered entertainment system), Mythbuntu is the distribution you want. Once you’ve installed Mythbuntu, you will then be prompted to walk through the setup of your Capture cards, recording profiles, video sources, and Input connections (Figure 4).

### Ubuntu Budgie

Ubuntu Budgie is the new kid on the block to the official flavor list. Sporting the Budgie Desktop, this is a beautiful and modern take on Linux that will please just about any type of user. The goal of Ubuntu Budgie was to create an elegant and simple desktop interface. Mission accomplished. If you’re looking for a beautiful desktop to work on top of the remarkably stable Ubuntu Linux platform, look no further than Ubuntu Budgie.

Adding this particular spin on Ubuntu to the list of official variants was a smart move on the part of Canonical. With Unity going away, they needed a desktop that would offer the elegance found in Unity. Customization of Budgie is very easy, and the list of included software will get you working and browsing immediately.

And, unlike the learning curve many users encountered with Unity, the developers/designers of Ubuntu Budgie have done a remarkable job of keeping this take on Ubuntu familiar. Click on the “start” button to reveal a fairly standard menu of applications. Budgie also includes an easy to use Dock (Figure 5) that holds applications launchers for quick access.

Another really nice feature found in Ubuntu Budgie is a sidebar that can be quickly revealed and hidden. This sidebar holds applets and notifications. With this in play, your desktop can be both incredibly useful, while remaining clutter free.

In the end, if you’re looking for something a bit different, that happens to also be a very modern take on the desktop—with features and functions not found on other distributions—Ubuntu Budgie is what you’re looking for.

### Xubuntu

Another official flavor of Ubuntu that does a nice job of providing a small footprint version of Linux is [Xubuntu][32]. The difference between Xubuntu and Lubuntu is that, where Lubuntu uses the LXDE desktop, Xubuntu makes use of [Xfce][33]. What you get with that difference is a lightweight desktop that is far more configurable (than Lubuntu) as well as one that includes the more business-ready LibreOffice office suite.

Xubuntu is an out of the box experience that anyone, regardless of experience, can use. But don't think that immediate familiarity means this flavor of Ubuntu is locked out of making it your own. If you're looking for a take on Ubuntu that's somewhat old-school out of the box, but can be heavily tweaked to better resemble a more modern desktop, Xubuntu is what you want.

One really handy addition to Xubuntu that I've always enjoyed (one that harks back to Enlightenment) is the ability to bring up the "start" menu by right-clicking anywhere on the desktop (Figure 6). This can make for very efficient usage.

### The choice is yours

There is a flavor of Ubuntu to meet nearly any need—which one you choose is up to you. As yourself questions such as:

*   What are your needs?

*   What type of desktop do you prefer to interact with?

*   Is your hardware aging?

*   Do you prefer a Windows XP/7 feel?

*   Are you wanting a multimedia system?

Your answers to the above questions will go a long way to determining which flavor of Ubuntu is right for you. The good news is that you can’t really go wrong with any of the available options.
